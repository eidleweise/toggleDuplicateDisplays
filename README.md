#Toggle Duplicate Displays
A quick powershell script that will toggle my displays between "Internal" and "Extend" using DisplaySwitch.

I was peeved that I couldn't quickly toggle my laptop either using its internal monitor when I tell my "real" monitor to display my main PC or extend my laptop display when the monitor is set to use the HDMI cable connected to my laptop. For some reason, my laptop see's the HDMI connection, and even though my monitor's displaying stuff from another input, my laptop doesn't know anything about it! So I made a quick script to toggle between what I wanted... I can't do it "automagically" like I'd like and I'd love to re-bind my laptop's useless "co-pilot" key so that when I click on it, I can just run my script, but this is working "good enough" for now!
